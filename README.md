  üéØ About Challenge 
</h3>

In this challenge, I developed an application to manage a shopping cart for a fictional coffee shop, which contains the following features:

- [x] List of products available for purchase
- [x] Add a specific number of items to the cart
- [x] Increase or decrease the number of items in the cart
- [x] Form for the user to fill in their address
- [x] Display total items in cart in Header
- [x] Display the total value of the sum of items in the cart multiplied by the value

I need to apply concepts like:

- State
- ContextAPI
- LocalStorage
- Imutability
- Lists and Kays in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization
